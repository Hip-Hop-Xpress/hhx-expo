          'Starting in the late 1990s, Dr. Will Patterson worked with youth at the Don Moyer Boys & Girls Club in Champaign and University students on projects that included fashion, spoken arts, and STEM. Flava Wear was a social entrepreneurial clothing project that Dr. Patterson developed with young people at the Club in 2001. In 2007, he built on the success of Flava Wear to create a civic scholarship model called IPOWERED. IPOWERED was created to provide African American college students with the knowledge needed to invest their expertise in economically depressed and marginalized communities.',
          'As Associate Director at the UI African American Cultural Center from 2005-2008, Dr. Patterson was vital to the internet-based radio station, WBML, and Griot, the literary magazine. In 2006, Dr. Patterson received the Campus Award for Excellence in Public Engagement as well as the local arts council’s ACE Award. These awards were due to his central role with the collaborative Youth Media Workshop (with WILL-TV, College of Education, and College of Media) that taught over 30 African American middle and high school students how to use media tools to produce documentaries about their communities.',
          'In 2008, Dr. Patterson was a Fellow with the University of Illinois Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership; Dr. Patterson’s students in his course, Hip Hop and Social Entrepreneurship, proposed projects with local residents and presented and advocated for their team’s ideas to outsiders. Previous courses taught by Dr. Patterson since the early 1990s—at the UI, at the Boys and Girls Club, at the Urban League—have examined leadership, arts and social change with youth-created media incorporated into the learning process.',
          'In 2016, Dr. Patterson began to pull various activities together under the phrase “Ghetto Genius Universe,” to recognize the ingenuity and brilliance within ghetto spaces and he presented his ideas in a TEDxUIUC talk in 2017.  Dr. Patterson defines Ghetto Genius as the cultural wealth produced from unique and new knowledge; this knowledge is born from and acquired by individuals in places and spaces that are undervalued, underestimated, and marginalized. Dr. Patterson acknowledges Ghetto Genius by immersing himself in spaces like the Don Moyer Boys & Girls Club in Champaign, a place in which he grew up.',
